This is my first Deep Learning project

Title: Design & Development of Cardiac Arrest Disease Detection through MRI Images using Deep Learning

Project Description:


In this project, I'm focusing on the design and development of a system for detecting cardiac arrest disease from MRI images. Leveraging the power of deep learning, particularly the YOLOv8 model, I aim to train a robust algorithm capable of accurately identifying signs of cardiac arrest in MRI scans.

Key Components:

Data Collection: Acquiring a comprehensive dataset of MRI images containing both normal and abnormal cases of cardiac conditions. These images will serve as the foundation for training the deep learning model.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the MRI images to enhance quality, normalize intensities, and potentially augment the dataset to improve model generalization.

Model Selection: Utilizing the YOLOv8 model, a state-of-the-art object detection architecture known for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting objects within images.

Training the Model: Training the YOLOv8 model using the preprocessed MRI dataset to learn the distinguishing features indicative of cardiac arrest.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tuning the model as necessary to optimize performance.

Deployment: Developing a user-friendly interface where clinicians and medical professionals can upload MRI images for automated cardiac arrest detection. This interface should provide clear and actionable insights based on the model's predictions.


Technologies and Tools:

Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch or TensorFlow for implementing the YOLOv8 model.
Data Processing: Python libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and PIL for image processing tasks.
Model Evaluation: Utilizing metrics from scikit-learn or custom evaluation scripts to assess model performance.
Deployment: Options include web-based interfaces using frameworks like Django.


Expected Outcome:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system for detecting cardiac arrest disease from MRI images. By leveraging deep learning techniques and the YOLOv8 model, the system aims to provide clinicians with an efficient tool for early diagnosis and intervention, potentially saving lives through timely medical intervention.
